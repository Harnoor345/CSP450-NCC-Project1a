# CSP450 â€“ Network Configuration Project (Project 1a)

This project was completed as part of the CSP450 course at Seneca Polytechnic College. It involved configuring a real-world network using **physical Aruba 6300 switches** and **Kali Linux virtual machines** in a lab environment.

##  What I Did
- Configured **VLANs** on Aruba 6300 switch for logical network segmentation.
- Deployed **Kali Linux VMs** connected to different VLANs.
- Set up **DHCP** for dynamic IP address assignment to VLAN interfaces.
- Enabled **SSH key-based authentication** between VMs for secure access.
- Used **static routing** on the switch to enable cross-VLAN communication.
- Verified and documented **internet connectivity** via NAT interface.
- Captured and analyzed traffic using **Wireshark**.

## Skills Gained
- Networking on **physical switches**
- VLAN, DHCP, SSH, and routing configuration
- Linux system administration
- Secure key-based authentication
- Network traffic analysis with Wireshark
